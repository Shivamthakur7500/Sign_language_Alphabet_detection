# Sign_language_Alphabet_detection
# 🤟 Sign Language Alphabet Detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project demonstrates a real-time Sign Language Alphabet Detection system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python. The goal is to enable communication through visual sign recognition by identifying hand gestures representing letters from the ASL (American Sign Language) alphabet.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

- 🖐️ Real-time hand gesture detection using **MediaPipe Hands**
- 🧠 Alphabet classification using custom-trained model
- 🎥 Webcam video capture and frame processing using **OpenCV**
- 💾 Option to record and save video locally
- 📊 Data collection and scatter plot visualizations (optional)
